## Overview

The logenricher hooks into write paths (`tty_write`, `pipe_write`, `ksys_write`, `do_writev`) to intercept log output. When a write occurs it:

1. Looks up `traces_ctx_v1[pid_tgid]` to get the active trace/span context for the calling thread.
2. Reads the user buffer via `bpf_probe_read_user`, packages the log line together with the trace context into a `log_event_t`, and submits it to the `log_events` ring buffer.
3. Overwrites the original user buffer with zeros via `bpf_probe_write_user` to suppress the un-enriched line.
4. User-space reads from the ring buffer and re-emits the log with `trace_id`/`span_id` injected into the JSON.

Because the original user buffer is zeroed out (step 3), the container log file will contain NULL characters in place of the original log line, terminated with `\n`. For writes up to 8 KiB this produces one fully-zeroed placeholder line that downstream tooling can drop with a single regex (see [Filtering the suppressed placeholder lines](#filtering-the-suppressed-placeholder-lines)). For writes larger than 8 KiB only the first 8 KiB is zeroed and terminated with `\n`; the remainder of the write reaches the container log un-enriched and will not match the placeholder regex — see [Limits](#limits). The enriched line is written separately by user-space, and the NULL suppression prevents the container runtime from capturing the un-enriched duplicate.

OBI only fills `trace_id`/`span_id` fields that are not already present in the JSON — if the application's logger or SDK already injected them (e.g. via Python `LoggingInstrumentor`), those values are preserved. For services OBI detects as exporting OTel traces directly (see [exclude-otel-instrumented-services](exclude-otel-instrumented-services.md)), only `trace_id` is injected and `span_id` is never written: OBI's BPF-generated `span_id` would not match the SDK's actual span and would point at a span the SDK emits under a different ID.

Both `ITER_UBUF` (kernel ≥ 6.0, used by `write()`) and `ITER_IOVEC` (all kernel versions, used by `writev()`) iterator types are supported. The `do_writev` kprobe captures the fd for `writev()` calls so `pipe_write` can resolve the file descriptor (registered as non-required — if the symbol isn't available, `write()`-based enrichment still works).

## The `traces_ctx_v1` map

`traces_ctx_v1` is a **pinned** `LRU_HASH` map shared across all BPF programs:

- **Key**: `u64 pid_tgid` — the combined PID and TID of the calling thread
- **Value**: `obi_ctx_info_t` — `trace_id[16]` + `span_id[8]`
- **Pinning**: `LIBBPF_PIN_BY_NAME` under `<bpf_fs_path>/otel/` (default `bpf_fs_path` is `/sys/fs/bpf`, configurable via `config.ebpf.bpf_fs_path` / `OTEL_EBPF_BPF_FS_PATH`).

The map is **written** by the generic tracer (in `server_or_client_trace()`) whenever an HTTP request or client call is detected on the wire. The map is **read** by the logenricher when intercepting writes.

## The context staleness problem

`traces_ctx_v1` is keyed by OS-level `pid_tgid`. This works when the thread that receives the HTTP data is the same thread that writes the log. But many runtimes decouple I/O from processing:

- **Go**: Goroutines are multiplexed onto OS threads (M's). A goroutine can resume on a different M after being descheduled.
- **Node.js**: The single-threaded event loop can read data for multiple in-flight requests (via libuv) before invoking any JS callback, overwriting `traces_ctx_v1` each time.
- **Java**: HTTP servers (Tomcat, Netty) use thread pools. The acceptor thread receives the data, but a worker thread from the pool processes the request and writes logs.
- **Ruby (Puma)**: When all workers are busy, the reactor thread reads HTTP data (setting context for itself), then hands off to a worker that has no context.
- **Python (asyncio)**: A single OS thread runs many tasks via the event loop. `pid_tgid` identifies the thread, not the request, so any `await` boundary that switches tasks would otherwise leave `traces_ctx_v1[pid_tgid]` pointing at whichever task ran most recently.

Without correction, `traces_ctx_v1[pid_tgid]` may carry the wrong trace context when a log is written. Each runtime has a dedicated mechanism to refresh the map at the right moment.

## Per-runtime context refresh

### Go — uprobe entry + `runtime.casgstatus` uprobe

Go's context refresh has two complementary mechanisms:

**1. Immediate set at uprobe entry**: Each Go protocol uprobe (HTTP `ServeHTTP`, gRPC `server_handleStream`, Redis `redis_process`, etc.) calls `obi_ctx__set(bpf_get_current_pid_tgid(), &tp)` immediately after storing the invocation in its per-goroutine map. This ensures `traces_ctx_v1` is populated from the very start of the handler, so log writes that happen before any goroutine reschedule are enriched.

**2. Refresh on goroutine status transitions**: The Go runtime calls `runtime.casgstatus` on every goroutine status transition. OBI hooks this function and, when a goroutine transitions to `g_running` (2) or `g_syscall` (3), looks up the goroutine's active operation (HTTP server, gRPC, Kafka, SQL, etc.) and calls `obi_ctx__set(pid_tgid, &tp)`. This fires on every context switch, so `traces_ctx_v1` stays in sync when a goroutine migrates to a different OS thread.

**3. Cleanup at return uprobes**: When the handler returns, the return uprobe deletes the per-goroutine map entry and calls `obi_ctx__del(pid_tgid)` to remove stale context from `traces_ctx_v1`.

**Why setting context at uprobe entry is safe**: At the moment the uprobe fires (e.g. `ServeHTTP`), the goroutine is guaranteed to be running on the current OS thread — `bpf_get_current_pid_tgid()` returns the correct `pid_tgid`. The `traces_ctx_v1` map uses `BPF_ANY` semantics, so the write is idempotent: the subsequent `casgstatus` transition will overwrite the entry with the same trace/span IDs. If the goroutine migrates to a different OS thread later, `casgstatus` handles the update for the new `pid_tgid`, and the `default` branch deletes the stale entry for the old one.

### Node.js — `async_hooks` before callback + `uv_fs_access` uprobe

The JS agent installs an `async_hooks` `createHook({ before() { ... } })`. Before each async callback executes, the hook calls `fs.accessSync('/dev/null/obi-ctx/<incomingFd>')`. This triggers the `obi_uv_fs_access` uprobe in BPF, which:

1. Parses the 4-digit fd from the path.
2. Looks up `fd_to_connection[pid_tgid, fd]` to get the connection info.
3. Calls `trace_info_for_connection(conn, TRACE_TYPE_SERVER)` to find the server trace.
4. Calls `obi_ctx__set(pid_tgid, &tp)` or `obi_ctx__del(pid_tgid)`.

This fires before every JS callback, ensuring the correct trace context is active even when multiple requests are interleaved in the event loop.

### Java — `k_ioctl_java_threads` in the ioctl kprobe

The Java agent uses ByteBuddy to intercept `Executor.execute()`, `Runnable.run()`, `Callable.call()`, and `ForkJoinTask` methods. When a task starts executing on a worker thread, `ThreadInfo.sendParentThreadContext(parentId)` sends an `ioctl(0, 0x0b10b1, packet)` with operation type `k_ioctl_java_threads` (3).

The BPF kprobe handler:

1. Updates `java_tasks[child_tid] = parent_tid` (thread hierarchy map).
2. Walks the `java_tasks` chain (up to 3 levels) looking up `server_traces` for each ancestor.
3. If a valid server trace is found, calls `obi_ctx__set(child_pid_tgid, &tp)`. Otherwise calls `obi_ctx__del`.

Unlike Node.js (which refreshes before every callback), Java only needs to refresh once when the task starts — Java threads don't multiplex like the Node.js event loop, so once a worker picks up a task it runs to completion on that OS thread.

### Ruby (Puma) — `rb_ary_shift` uprobe

Puma has two paths for incoming requests. In the **direct path**, the worker thread reads HTTP data itself — `server_or_client_trace()` fires on the worker and sets `traces_ctx_v1` correctly with no extra work. In the **reactor path** (when all workers are busy), the reactor thread reads HTTP data (setting `traces_ctx_v1` for itself), then enqueues the connection for a worker thread that has no context.

OBI hooks `rb_ary_shift` (Ruby's `Array#shift`), which fires when a Puma worker picks up a task from the todo queue. The BPF handler:

1. Updates `puma_worker_tasks[worker_tid] = reactor_tid` (thread mapping).
2. Looks up `server_traces_aux` via `puma_task_connections` to find the reactor's server trace.
3. If found, calls `obi_ctx__set(worker_pid_tgid, &tp)`.

In the direct path, `server_traces_aux` won't have an entry yet (HTTP hasn't been parsed), so step 2 is a harmless no-op.

### Python (asyncio) — `task_step` / `context_run` uprobes

OBI hooks the CPython internals that mark every async transition:

- `_asyncio.Task.__init__` → records the new task and its parent so each task carries the request connection it was created under.
- `PyContext_CopyCurrent` (and `context_new_from_vars` under tail-call optimization) → binds the copied `PyContext*` to the task that owns it, including child tasks created via `asyncio.create_task` and worker contexts copied for `asyncio.to_thread`.
- `_asyncio.Task.task_step` (3.12+) / `task_step_legacy` (< 3.12) → fires when the event loop resumes a task. The handler walks the task's parent chain (up to 4 levels) to find the owning server connection in `server_traces_aux` and calls `obi_ctx__set(pid_tgid, &tp)`.
- `task_step_ret` → fires when a task yields back to the loop. The handler calls `obi_ctx__del(pid_tgid)` so logs emitted from idle event-loop code aren't attributed to the previous task.
- `libpython3.context_run` → covers the `asyncio.to_thread` worker thread, where the user function runs inside a copied context but no `task_step` ever fires. The handler resolves the originating task via `python_context_task[context]` and refreshes `traces_ctx_v1` for the worker `pid_tgid`.

Together these probes keep `traces_ctx_v1[pid_tgid]` aligned with whichever async task is currently executing, so logs written between any two `await` points get the correct trace/span IDs.

This works for plain `asyncio` and uvloop (the probe targets are CPython's `_asyncio` module and `libpython3.so` — both loops drive the same task machinery). Greenlet/gevent are out of scope: their context switches happen entirely inside the greenlet C extension and don't touch any of the probed symbols.

## Per-runtime stdout buffering

The logenricher reads `traces_ctx_v1[pid_tgid]` at the moment the `write()` syscall fires. If the runtime buffers stdout and flushes asynchronously — on a different thread or after the request handler returns — the trace context for that TID will already be gone, and the log line will not be enriched.

Each runtime behaves differently:

| Runtime | Default stdout behaviour | Works out of the box? |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Go | `fmt.Println` calls `write()` synchronously on the goroutine | Yes — Go refreshes `traces_ctx_v1` on every goroutine context switch via `runtime.casgstatus` |
| Node.js | `process.stdout.write()` is synchronous | Yes |
| Java | `System.out.println()` flushes immediately (PrintStream `autoFlush=true` by default) | Yes |
| Ruby | `puts` / `STDOUT.syswrite` — both issue `write()`/`writev()` synchronously on the request thread | Yes |
| Python | stdout is block-buffered when not a TTY (Docker) | **No** — set `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` |
| .NET | `Console.Out` (StreamWriter) is block-buffered when stdout is a pipe | **No** — see below |

### .NET specifics

.NET's `Console.Out` wraps a `StreamWriter` with `AutoFlush = false` by default. When stdout is a pipe (as in Docker), writes are buffered until the buffer fills (4 KB) or the writer is flushed explicitly. The `write()` syscall may fire on a GC finalizer thread or when a later request fills the buffer — in both cases the TID no longer carries trace context.

**Fix**: configure auto-flush at application startup:

```csharp
var stdout = new StreamWriter(Console.OpenStandardOutput()) { AutoFlush = true };
Console.SetOut(stdout);
```

**Microsoft.Extensions.Logging `AddConsole()` does not work**, even with `AutoFlush` set. The built-in console logger uses an internal background `Channel`: log entries are queued and drained by a dedicated writer thread whose TID has no trace context. This applies to ASP.NET Core's default logging pipeline.

**Logging frameworks that do work**:

- `Console.WriteLine` with `AutoFlush = true` (synchronous, same thread)
- Serilog `WriteTo.Console()` — writes synchronously on the calling thread by default
- NLog `targets/ColoredConsole` with `queueLimit=0` (synchronous mode)

There is no environment variable equivalent to Python's `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for .NET.

## Filtering the suppressed placeholder lines

Each traced `write()`/`writev()` of up to 8 KiB leaves one placeholder
line in the container log: the original bytes are overwritten with NULs
and a trailing `\n`. Drop them downstream with the regex
`^[\x00\s]*$`. Writes larger than 8 KiB only produce a placeholder for
the first 8 KiB; the leaked tail bypasses this filter — see
[Limits](#limits).

JSON log envelopes (CRI body, Docker `log` field) serialise NUL as
`\u0000`; both shippers below decode the JSON string before the filter
runs, so the regex matches real `\x00` bytes.

### OpenTelemetry Collector — `filelog` receiver

The `container` operator handles CRI and Docker JSON formats and
exposes the line in `body`.

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /var/log/pods/*/*/*.log
    start_at: end
    operators:
      - type: container
      - type: filter
        expr: 'body matches "^[\\x00\\s]*$"'
```

### Fluent Bit

```ini
[INPUT]
    Name              tail
    Path              /var/log/pods/*/*/*.log
    multiline.parser  cri
    Tag               kube.*

[FILTER]
    Name    grep
    Match   *
    Exclude log ^[\x00\s]*$
```

### Legacy: Docker JSON log driver

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log]
    operators:
      - type: json_parser
        parse_from: body
        parse_to: attributes
      - type: filter
        # bracket access: `log` collides with expr-lang math.log
        expr: 'attributes["log"] matches "^[\\x00\\s]*$"'
```

## Requirements

- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability and permission to use `bpf_probe_write_user` (kernel security lockdown mode should be `[none]`)
- The target application writes logs in **JSON format**
- Log writes must occur synchronously on the request-handling thread (see [Per-runtime stdout buffering](#per-runtime-stdout-buffering) above)
- BPFFS mounted at `/sys/fs/bpf` (or another mountpath configurable via `config.ebpf.bpf_fs_path` / `OTEL_EBPF_BPF_FS_PATH`)

## Limits

- **Per-write cap of 8 KiB.** Bytes past 8 KiB in a single `write()`/`writev()` are not zeroed or enriched; they leak through the tty/pipe as-is.
